# Notivlaai

This is a small web application that should contain the following pages

* A page in which delivery info can be requested and an order can be dispatched to the delivery room
* A page which should be blank in which a dispatched order can be viewed and the order can be retrieved


Because this is in context of the yearly 'vlaaienactie' (a vlaai being a dutch kind of pastry), the order will be a collection of
these vlaaien
